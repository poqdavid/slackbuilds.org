.PP
In addition to this, you can run any asciinema command with the
.B -h
switch to display help about that specific command. For example, try running \fBasciinema rec -h\fP. This will display a list of all of the options \fBrec\fP command accepts, with their defaults.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B rec
.RS 4
Record terminal session and upload it to asciinema.org site.
.PP
This is the single most important command in \fIasciinema\fP, since it is how you utilize this tool's main job.
.PP
By running \fIasciinema\fP rec you start a new recording session. The command (process) that is recorded can be specified with \fI-c\fP option (see below), and defaults to \fB$SHELL\fP which is what you want in most cases.
.PP
Recording finishes when you exit the shell (hit \fBCtrl+D\fP or type \fIexit\fP). If the recorded process is not a shell than recording finishes when the process exits.
.PP
\fBASCIINEMA_REC=1\fP is added to recorded process environment variables. This can be used by your shell's config file (\fI.bashrc\fP, \fI.zshrc\fP) to alter the prompt or play a sound when shell is being recorded.
